TASK 1 CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASEDRESPONSES
Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based onpredefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matchingtechniques to identify user queries and provide appropriateresponses. This will give you a basic understanding of naturallanguage processing and conversation flow.
TIC-TAC-TOE AI
Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toeagainst a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax withor without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.This project will help you understand game theory and basic searchalgorithms.
IMAGE CAPTIONING
Combine computer vision and natural language processing to buildan image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition modelslike VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use arecurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model togenerate captions for those images.
